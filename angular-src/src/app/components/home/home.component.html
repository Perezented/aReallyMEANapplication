    <h3><b>MongoDB</b></h3>
    <p>
      Mongo Atlas is used to connect to the database. Heroku is used to deploy
      but since Nov. 2020, mLabs is not available. Other options were available
      but Mongo Atlas worked excellent with Heroku.
    </p>
    <p>
      User database is housed by a MongoDB server. Mongoose was used in the
      Node/Express section to connect to MongoDB. A Mongoose Schema was used as
      well in the Users model to confirm the users sent in to register. Bcrypt
      was used to hash the passwords to save on the database. It then compares
      to authorize users to specific protected routes.

    <h3><b>Express/Node</b></h3>
    <p>
      Back end server is developed using Node.js alongside its trusty sidekick,
      Express.js. The server is also running on CORS, JSON Web Token
      passport-jwt, Mongoose. Passport simplified the JSON Web Token
      authentication to authorize logged-in users to protected routes.
      Authentication is received using an 'Authentication header with a
      'bearer'. A JWT is sent back to the front end for the rest of the session,
      6 hrs. The server is currently mainly for usersâ€™ information to register
      and log in.

    <h3><b>Angular</b></h3>
    <p>
      The login to this page to view all components is 'admin' with a password
      of 'password'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page you are currently on was developed using Angular. It is comprised
      of 6 main components with some helpers. The login and register information
      is relayed to the Node/Express + MongoDB server. It is hashed in between
      so the database is not holding text passwords, very important. Flash
      messages are used to display quick messages when a user is logged in or
      not able to log in. There is some incorporation of AuthGuards so a user
      cannot get to '/profile' nor '/dashboard' until logged in. The nav bar
      will check to see if a user is logged in to display the correct
      'login/logout' links.
